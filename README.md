# ValpoFilamentRecyclerCode

#What's in each folder:
* Extruder - code for our extruder.
* Spooler - code for the spooling machine.
* Motor - example sketch for the extruder's DC motor driver.
* Encoder - test code for the extruder's rotary encoder.
* mega_controller - legacy code from when the extruder and spooler were combined into one machine.
* nano_diameter - experimental code for the spooler to measure the diameter of the filament, which is a prerequisite for a software control loop that would automate the spooler.
